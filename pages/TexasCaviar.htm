		<p>Cowpeas into caviar. Anything is possible in Texas. This simple dish proves 
			the perfection of canned black-eyed peas. The onion and bell pepper provide 
			a delicate crunch, the vinegar a slight tang. For picnics, diets, our Three 
			Salad Lunch Special or good luck on New Yearâ€™s Day, you really ought to get
			enough practice on this one to make it easy and frequent.
