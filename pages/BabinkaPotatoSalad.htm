		<h3 id="recipe3">Babinka's Potato Salad</h3>
		<ul class="ingredients">
			<li>4 Large potatoes (to be diced after boiling)</li>
			<li>4 hard-boiled eggs, diced</li>
			<li>3 heaping Tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
			<li>2 heaping Tablespoon mustard</li>
			<li>About 1/2 or more of a large pickle, diced</li>
			<li>About 1/2 cup or more, cooked peas</li>
			<li>Lawrey's (or other) Season Salt, to taste</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Peel the potatoes, boil them for forty minutes or slightly more.  They 
should be barely firm enough to dice them (without mashing them).  Allow 
the potatoes to cool before trying to dice them. When dicing, the chunks 
can be fairly coarse.</p>

		<p>Dice the eggs and pickles.  These chunks should be smaller than the potato 
chunks, perhaps the size of large peas.</p>

		<p>Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.  Adjust the mayo, mustard, and salt, 
to taste.</p>
