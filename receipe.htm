		<p><em>Cowpeas into caviar. Anything is possible in Texas. This simple dish proves 
			the perfection of canned black-eyed peas. The onion and bell pepper provide 
			a delicate crunch, the vinegar a slight tang. For picnics, diets, our Three 
			Salad Lunch Special or good luck on New Year’s Day, you really ought to get
			enough practice on this one to make it easy and frequent.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

BABINKA'S POTATO SALAD

4 Large potatoes (to be diced after boiling)
4 hard-boiled eggs, diced
3 heaping Tablespoons mayonnaise
1 heaping Tablespoon mustard
About 1/2 or more of a large pickle, diced
About 1/2 cup or more, cooked peas
Lawrey's (or other) Season Salt, to taste

Peel the potatoes, boil them for forty minutes or slightly more.  They 
should be barely firm enough to dice them (without mashing them).  Allow 
the potatoes to cool before trying to dice them.  When dicing, the chunks 
can be fairly coarse.

Dice the eggs and pickles.  These chunks should be smaller than the potato 
chunks, perhaps the size of large peas.

Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.  Adjust the mayo, mustard, and salt, 
to taste.
